    <h2>Molecular biology of kidney</h2><br>
    cellular diversity modulates a variety of complex physiologic processes. <br>
    Endocrine functions, the regulation of blood pressure and intraglomerular hemodynamics, solute and water transport, acid-base balance, and removal of drug metabolites<br>

    <h3><span style="text-transform:uppercase">Embryogenic development</span></h3>
    <img src="kidneydevelopment.jpg" width=50%><br>
    There are ~900,000 glomeruli in each kidney in normal birth weight adults and as few as 225,000 in low-birth-weight adults, with the latter producing numerous comorbid risks.<br>


    <h3>DETERMINANTS AND REGULATION OF GLOMERULAR FILTRATION</h3>
    Renal blood flow normally drains ~20% of the cardiac output, or 1000 mL/min.<br>

    <img src="tubule2.jpg" width=30%><br><br>

    <span style=font-weight:bold>The hydrostatic pressure gradient</span> across the glomerular capillary wall is the primary driving force for glomerular filtration.<br>
    <span style=font-weight:bold>Oncotic pressure </span> within the capillary lumen, determined by the concentration of unfiltered plasma proteins, partially offsets the hydrostatic pressure gradient and opposes filtration.<br>
    Although glomerular filtration is affected by renal artery pressure, this relationship is not linear across the range of physiologic blood pressures due to <span style=text-decoration:underline>autoregulation of GFR.</span><br>
    <ul><li>autonomous vasoreactive (myogenic) reflex in the afferent arteriole</li><br> The myogenic reflex is a first line of defense against fluctuations in renal blood flow. This phenomenon helps protect the glomerular capillary from sudden changes in systolic pressure. <br><br>
      <li>tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF)</li><br> TGF changes the rate of filtration and tubular flow by reflex vasoconstriction or dilatation of the afferent arteriole.<br>
      TGF is mediated by specialized cells called the macula densa that act as sensors of solute concentration and tubular fluid flow rate.<br><br>
       <li>angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole</li><br>
       During states of reduced renal blood flow, renin is released from granular cells.<br>
       Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).<br>
        Angiotensin II evokes vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole, and the resulting increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure elevates GFR to normal levels.<br><br>
        </ul>


    <h3>MECHANISMS OF RENAL TUBULAR TRANSPORT</h3>
    <img src="cortexmedulla.jpg" width=30%><br>
    Renal epithelial cells are said to be polarized.<br>
    The asymmetric assignment of membrane proteins, especially proteins mediating transport processes, provides the machinery for directional movement of fluid and solutes by the nephron.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Paracellular transport</li><br>
        Leaky epithelia, and tight epithelia.<br>
        The proximal tubule contains leaky epithelia, whereas distal nephron segments, such as the collecting duct, contain tight epithelia. Leaky epithelia are most well suited for bulk fluid reabsorption, whereas tight epithelia allow for more refined control and regulation of transport.<br><br>
      <li>Cellular transport</li> 세포수송에 문제가 생겨서 나타나는 질환들이 많이 있다.<br>
        The movement of solutes and water across cell membranes is made possible by discrete classes of integral membrane proteins, including channels, pumps, and transporters.<br>
        active transport (pumps), passive transport (channels), facilitated diffusion (transporters), and secondary active transport (cotransporters)<br>

    <h4>PROXIMAL TUBULE</h4>
    The proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing ~60% of filtered NaCl and water, as well as ~90% of filtered bicarbonate and most critical nutrients such as glucose and amino acids.<br>
    Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as <span style=font-weight:bold>acetazolamide </span>, a class of weak diuretic agents, block proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption and are useful for alkalinizing the urine.

    <h4>LOOP OF HENLE</h4>
    The loop of Henle is the site of action for <span style=text-decoration:underline>the most potent class of diuretic agents</span><br>
    "이 약은 나트륨, 염소의 배설을 증가시키고 그에 따라 수분의 배설도 증가시킨다. 게다가 칼륨, 칼슘, 마그네슘 등의 다른 전해질의 배설도 증가시킨다" <span style=font-weight:bold> (loop diuretics) </span> <br>
    An inherited disorder of the thick ascending limb, <span style=font-weight:bold> Bartter’s syndrome </span>, also results in a salt-wasting renal disease associated with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.<br>


    <h4>DISTAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE</h4>
    This segment is composed of a tight epithelium with little water permeability.<br>
    Loss-of-function mutations of SLC12A3 encoding the apical Na+/Cl− cotransporter cause  <span style=font-weight:bold>Gitelman syndrome</span>, a salt-wasting disorder associated with hypokalemic alkalosis and hypocalciuria.<br>


    <h4>COLLECTING DUCT</h4>
    The antidiuretic hormone <span style=font-weight:bold>vasopressin</span> binds to the V2 receptor on the basolateral membrane and triggers an intracellular signaling cascade, resulting in an increase in the cellular levels of cyclic AMP.<br>
    This signaling cascade stimulates the insertion of water channels into the apical membrane of collecting duct cells to promote increased water permeability.<br>
    This increase in permeability enables water reabsorption and production of concentrated urine. <span style=text-decoration:underline>In the absence of vasopressin, collecting duct cells are water impermeable, and urine remains dilute.</span><br>
    The cortical collecting duct contains high-resistance epithelia with two cell types. Principal cells are the main water, Na+-reabsorbing, and K+-secreting cells, and the site of action of <span style=font-weight:bold>aldosterone</span>, <span style=text-decoration:underline>K+-sparing diuretics</span>, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as <span style=font-weight:bold>spironolactone</span> and eplerenone.<br>

    <p> The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is the best-understood hormonal system modulating renal Na+ excretion. <br>
      Renin and ACE activity eventually produce angiotensin II that directly and indirectly promotes renal Na+ and water reabsorption.<br>
      Stimulation of proximal tubular Na+/H+ exchange by angiotensin II directly increases Na+ reabsorption. <br>
       Angiotensin II also promotes Na+ reabsorption along the collecting duct by stimulating aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.<br>
       Finally, angiotensin II inhibits renin secretion through a negative feedback loop. <br>
