  <h1>DIALYSIS IN THE TREATMENT OF RENAL FAILURE</h1>
     In the United States alone, there are now ~675,000 patients with treated ESRD (kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation), the vast majority of whom require dialysis.<br>
     In the United States, the leading cause of ESRD is diabetes mellitus, currently accounting for almost 45% of newly diagnosed cases of ESRD. Approximately 30% of patients have ESRD that has been attributed to hypertension, although it is unclear whether in these cases hypertension is the cause or a consequence of vascular disease or other unknown causes of kidney failure. Other prevalent causes of ESRD include glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and obstructive uropathy.<br>
     A fraction of the excess incidence of ESRD in African Americans is likely related to transmission of high-risk alleles for the APOL1 gene.<br>
     <br>
     In the United States, the mortality rate of patients on dialysis has decreased slightly but remains extremely high, with a 5-year survival rate of ~40% for patients receiving dialysis. Deaths are due mainly to cardiovascular diseases and infections (~40 and 10% of deaths, respectively)<br>
     <br>
     Commonly accepted criteria for initiating patients on maintenance dialysis include the presence of <br>
     uremic symptoms, the presence of hyperkalemia unresponsive to conservative measures, persistent extracellular volume expansion despite diuretic therapy, acidosis refractory to medical therapy, a bleeding diathesis, and a creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) %lt;10 mL/min per 1.73 m2<br>


     <h2>HEMODIALYSIS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Dialyzer</li>
       <li>Dialysate</li>
       <li>Blood delivery system</li>
       <li>Dialysis access</li>
       <li>Goals of hemodialysis</li>
       The hemodialysis procedure consists of pumping heparinized blood through the dialyzer at a flow rate of 250–450 mL/min, while dialysate flows in an opposite counter-current direction at 500–800 mL/min. <br>
       <br>
       <li>Complications during hemodialysis</li>
       Hypotension is the most common acute complication of hemodialysis, particularly among patients with diabetes mellitus.<br>
       Midodrine, an oral selective α1 adrenergic agent, has been advocated by some practitioners, although there is insufficient evidence of its safety and efficacy to support its routine use.<br>
       Muscle cramps during dialysis are also a common complication.<br>
       Anaphylactoid reactions to the dialyzer, particularly on its first use, have been reported most frequently with the bioincompatible cellulosic-containing membranes.This reaction typically occurs soon after the initiation of a treatment (within the first few minutes) and can progress to full-blown anaphylaxis if the therapy is not promptly discontinued.<br>
      </ul>

     <h2>PERITONEAL DIALYSIS</h2>
     In peritoneal dialysis, 1.5–3 L of a dextrose-containing solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period of time, usually 2–4 h.<br>
     In CAPD, dialysate is manually infused into the peritoneal cavity and exchanged three to five times during the day. A nighttime dwell is frequently instilled at bedtime and remains in the peritoneal cavity through the night.<br>
     <ul>
       <li>Access to peritoneal cavity</li>
       Access to the peritoneal cavity is obtained through a peritoneal catheter. Catheters used for maintenance peritoneal dialysis are flexible, being made of silicone rubber with numerous side holes at the distal end.<br>
       These catheters usually have two Dacron cuffs. The scarring that occurs around the cuffs anchors the catheter and seals it from bacteria tracking from the skin surface into the peritoneal cavity; it also prevents the external leakage of fluid from the peritoneal cavity. The cuffs are placed in the preperitoneal plane and ~2 cm from the skin surface.<br>
       <li>Complications during peritoneal dialysis</li>
       The major complications of peritoneal dialysis are peritonitis, catheter-associated nonperitonitis infections, weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, and residual uremia (especially among patients with little or no residual kidney function).<br>
       Peritonitis is usually defined by an elevated peritoneal fluid leukocyte count (100/mm3, of which at least 50% are polymorphonuclear neutrophils); these cutoffs are lower than in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis because of the presence of dextrose in peritoneal dialysis solutions and rapid bacterial proliferation in this environment without antibiotic therapy. <br>
       The clinical presentation typically consists of pain and cloudy dialysate, often with fever and other constitutional symptoms. The most common culprit organisms are gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus, reflecting the origin from the skin.<br>
       Most cases of peritonitis can be managed either with intraperitoneal or oral antibiotics, depending on the organism; many patients with peritonitis do not require hospitalization.<br>
