    <h2>Gout</h2><br>
    including monosodium urate (MSU) It results from an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. <br>
    It typically is characterized by episodic acute arthritis or chronic arthritis caused by deposition of MSU crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis<br>
    The metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe often is involved, but <span style=text-decoration:underline> tarsal joints, ankles, and knees also are affected commonly.</span><br>
    Several events may precipitate acute gouty arthritis: dietary excess, <span style=text-decoration:underline>trauma,</span> surgery, excessive ethanol ingestion, hypouricemic therapy, and serious medical illnesses such as myocardial infarction and stroke.<br>
    <h3>Laboratory Diagnosis</h3>
    Even if the clinical appearance strongly suggests gout, the presumptive diagnosis ideally <span style=text-decoration:underline>should be confirmed by needle aspiration</span> of acutely or chronically involved joints or tophaceous deposits.<br>
    During acute gouty attacks, needle-shaped MSU crystals typically are seen both intracellularly and extracellularly<br>
    MSU crystals also can often be demonstrated in the first metatarsophalangeal joint and in knees not acutely involved with gout. Arthrocentesis of these joints is a useful technique to establish the diagnosis of gout between attacks.<br>
    Serum uric acid levels can be normal or low at the time of an acute attack, Nevertheless, serum urate levels are almost always elevated at some time and are important to use to follow the course of hypouricemic therapy.<br>
    Urinalysis, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) count, liver function tests, and serum lipids should be obtained because of possible pathologic sequelae of gout and other associated diseases requiring treatment and as baselines because of possible adverse effects of gout treatment.<br>

    <h3>Radiographic Features</h3>
Cystic changes, well-defined erosions with sclerotic margins (often with overhanging bony edges), and soft tissue masses are characteristic radiographic features of advanced chronic tophaceous gout.

    <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
    <h4>Acute gout arthritis</h4>
    The mainstay of treatment during an acute attack is the <span style=text-decoration:underline>administration of anti-inflammatory drugs</span> such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or glucocorticoids.<br>
    <span style=font-weight:bold>NSAIDs</span> are used most often in individuals without complicating comorbid conditions. <br>
    Both colchicine and NSAIDs may be poorly tolerated and dangerous in the elderly and in the presence of <span style=text-decoration:underline>renal insufficiency and gastrointestinal disorders.</span><br>
    NSAIDs given in full anti-inflammatory doses are effective in ~90% of patients, and the resolution of signs and symptoms usually occurs in 5–8 days. The most effective drugs are any of those with a short half-life and include <span style=text-decoration:underline>indomethacin, 25–50 mg tid; naproxen, 500 mg bid; ibuprofen, 800 mg tid; diclofenac, 50 mg tid; and celecoxib 800 mg followed by 400 mg 12 h later, then 400 mg bid.</span><br>

    <span style=font-weight:bold>Glucocorticoids</span> given as an intramuscular injection or orally, for example, prednisone, 30–50 mg/d as the initial dose and gradually tapered with the resolution of the attack, can be effective in polyarticular gout.<br>

    <h3>HYPOURICEMIC THERAPY</h3>
    **Urate-lowering drugs are generally not initiated during acute attacks, but after the patient is stable and low-dose colchicine has been initiated to decrease the risk of the flares that often, without anti-inflammatory treatment, occur with urate lowering.<br><br><br>
    Ultimate control of gout requires correction of the basic underlying defect: the hyperuricemia. <br>
    Attempts to normalize serum uric acid to "<"300–360 μmol/L (5.0–6.0 mg/dL) to prevent recurrent gouty attacks and eliminate tophaceous deposits are critical and entail a commitment to hypouricemic regimens and medications that generally are required for life.<br>
    The decision to initiate hypouricemic therapy <span style=text-decoration:underline>usually is made taking into consideration</span> the number of acute attacks (urate lowering may be cost-effective after two attacks), serum uric acid levels (progression is more rapid in patients with serum uric acid >535 μmol/L [>9.0 mg/dL]), the patient’s willingness to commit to lifelong therapy, or the presence of uric acid stones. <br>
    Urate-lowering therapy <span style=text-decoration:underline>should be initiated</span> in any patient who already has tophi or chronic gouty arthritis.
    <ul>
      <strong><Li>Probenecid</li><br></strong>
        -can be used in patients with good renal function who underexcrete uric acid, with '<'600 mg in a 24-h urine sample. Urine volume should be maintained by ingestion of 1500 mL of water every day.<br>
        -can be started at a dose of 250 mg twice daily and increased gradually as needed up to 3 g per day to achieve and maintain a serum uric acid level of ''<'6 mg/dL.<br>
        -is generally not effective in patients with serum creatinine levels >177 μmol/L (2 mg/dL).<br><br>

      <strong><Li>Allopurinol</li><br></strong>
        -is by <span style=text-decoration:underline>far the most commonly used hypouricemic agent and is the best drug</span> to lower serum urate in overproducers, urate stone formers, and patients with renal disease.
        -can be given in a <span style=text-decoration:underline>single morning dose, usually 100 mg initially and increasing up to 800 mg if needed.</span><br>
        -Doses can be increased gradually to reach the target urate level of less than 6 mg/dL. <br>
        **The most serious side effects include life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis, systemic vasculitis, bone marrow suppression, granulomatous hepatitis, and renal failure.<br><br>

      <strong><Li>Febuxostat</li></strong><br>
        -is approved in the United States at <span style=text-decoration:underline>40 or 80 mg once a day</span> and does not require dose adjustment in mild to moderate renal disease. <br>
